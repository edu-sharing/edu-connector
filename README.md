# Hints & ToDos
## etherpad
New pads will be created but the reference is not saved to repository at this time. See `Etherpad.php` for details.
## H5P
As all required metadata is handled in edu-sharing itself, it will be ignored in editor. uploading of content is disabled as it should be done in edu-sharing workspace.
